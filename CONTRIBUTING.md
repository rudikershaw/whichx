## Contributing

To get started making changes to the project you will need to;

1. Install node\* and npm.
2. Run `npm run build` in the root of the project.

As long as any changes you make pass all linting checks and unit tests, feel free to raise a pull request. Please write new tests for any changes you make.

\* If you are having issues running `npm run build`, you can check which version of node is being used by the Travis CI builds by consulting [.travis.yml](../.travis.yml) configuration file.
